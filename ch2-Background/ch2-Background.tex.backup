\chapter{Background}

% Introduce what is planning under uncertainty
Planning and reasoning under uncertainty is central to robotic and artificial intelligence research and has 
been an active area of research for decades. It is an umbrella term which touches a
wide spectrum of fields: \textit{economics}, \textit{psychology}, \textit{cognitive science}, \textit{neuroscience},
\textit{robotics} and \textit{artificial intelligence}. The work in this thesis relies on results  and assumptions 
made in cognitive and neuroscience with respect to our beliefs and how we act given them. We complement 
these results by introducing them in a new light to the field of robotics and demonstrate how the human reasoning and belief system 
can be used in situations where the state space is partially observable. The second main theme our work builds on is 
state space estimation. The third component acting given uncertainty in robotics. We make use of results from all 
three fields. We provide a background overview of acting under uncertainty and situate our work within the state of the 
art.

This chapter unfolds as follows: 



\section{Planning and Uncertainty}
% What is the the reasoning under uncertainty planning problem
% What are all the assumptions which can be made regading the belief

\subsection{The problem}

Planning, control and decision theory are concerned with finding a set of actions which will lead to the 
successful outcome of a problem being considered; this the most generic definition. There are two 
key attributes which can make this problem difficult: stochastic actions and latent states. Stochastic 
actions, when applied in the same state will not always lead to the same outcome. This type of uncertainty 
can arise from many sources; the outcome of chaotic actions are impossible to predict with certainty, 
think of throwing a die or flipping a coin; In outdoor robotics the terrain might lead to slippage, causing 
the robot to skid or underwater currents might drastically offset the position of an UAV; In articulated 
robots the friction between joints can accumulate to a large error in the end-effector position (especially true 
for cable driven robots). 
The second source of uncertainty is when the underlying state is partially known, in the sense that we do not 
have all the necessary information to reliably determine the state beyond reasonable doubt. In robotics this 
uncertainty can arise from inadequate or noisy sensors. If the environmental conditions in which the robot 
is located is humid, misty or dark. It can make it difficult for the robot ascertain its position and 
makes it difficult to plan how to achieve a given objective.

The uncertainty of the state and actions have to be quantified. The predominant approach 
is to  represent them by probabilities. For instance the application of a forward action (for a wheeled robot) 
will result in a new position further ahead and a position to the right (due to slippage) with some probability.
An observation through the robots sensors will result in probability distribution over the robots probable location.
Given this quantification of action and observation uncertainty in terms of a probability distribution over the state, 
the agent must now take actions towards accomplishing its goal. To take a decision the agent must assign a utility 
to the outcome of his actions. The utility is to indicate a preference over the outcomes and when combined with 
probabilities leads to decision theory.  Decision theory is concerned with the study of uncertainty in decision 
making

\subsection{Partially Observable Markov Decision Process}

A POMDP is a popular approach for formulating a decision making process under both motion and measurement uncertainty;
In Figure \ref{fig:pomdp_tik} we describe all of the components necessary for a POMDP.

Since the states are not observable, the agent cannot choose its actions based on the state. The explicit 
representation of the past events is typically memory expensive. Instead it is possible to summarize all relevant 
information from previous actions and observations in a probability distribution over the state space, known as the
belief state. 


Because the state space is partially observable the expected reward has to be computed for each possible history of states, actions and observations.
All approaches in the literature instead encapsulate all these possible histories into a belief state $b_t(x_t)$ which is a 
probability distribution (referred to in the POMDP literature as an information state, \textit{I}-state) over the state space $x_t$ and use this 
new state description to cast the POMDP into a \textit{belief}-MDP (states are probability distributions, beliefs). 

The new description of the problem is now in terms of belief space $<\mathcal{B},U,\tau,R,\gamma>$ where $\mathcal{B}$ is the set of 
all possible beliefs and 
The reward becomes a function of the belief $R(b_t,u_t)$ which is the expected value of the original reward 
function $\mathbb{E}_{x_t \sim b_t}[R(x_t,u_t)]$, The goal is to find an optimal action for each belief such that 
the policy $\pi(b_t,u_t)$ maximises the expected reward, Equation \ref{eq:optimal_value_f}.

\begin{align}\label{eq:optimal_value_f}
% V^{\pi^*}(b_{t-1}) &= \mathbb{E}\left[\sum\limits_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^{t} R(x_t,u_t) \bigg| \pi,b_{t-1}\right]\\
 V^{\pi^*}(b_{t-1}) &= \max_{u_{t-1}} \bigg[ R(b_{t-1},u_{t-1}) + \gamma \cdot \mathbb{E}_{y_t}\left[ V^{\pi}(b_t)  \right] \bigg]
\end{align}

From considering the decision belief tree of the POMDP, Figure \ref{fig:pomdp_bel_tree}, we can appreciate the complexity of the problem
of finding an optimal policy. Given a discrete set of actions and observations to update the belief $b_1$ we have to consider a time 
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(|U||Y|^T)$ where $T$ is the depth of the tree (the planning horizon). Given that we have a finite set of 
belief the complexity solving the POMDP is $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{B}||U||Y|^T)$.

% Introduce what is planning under uncertainty
Planning and reasoning under uncertainty is central to robotic and artificial intelligence research and has 
been an active area of research for decades. It is an umbrella term which touches a
wide spectrum of fields: \textit{economics}, \textit{psychology}, \textit{cognitive science}, \textit{neuroscience},
\textit{robotics} and \textit{artificial intelligence}. The work in this thesis relies on results  and assumptions 
made in cognitive and neuroscience with respect to our beliefs and how we act given them. We complement 
these results by introducing them in a new light to the field of robotics and demonstrate how the human reasoning and belief system 
can be used in situations where the state space is partially observable. The second main theme our work builds on is 
state space estimation. The third component acting given uncertainty in robotics. We make use of results from all 
three fields. We provide a background overview of acting under uncertainty and situate our work within the state of the 
art.

This chapter unfolds as follows: 



\section{Decisions under Uncertainty}
% What is the the reasoning under uncertainty planning problem
% What are all the assumptions which can be made regading the belief

In this section we introduce and frame the problem we seek to solve in generic 
terms. We are concerned with finding a sequence of actions which will lead to the successful 
outcome of a problem being considered; this is the most generic definition. 

There are two key attributes which can make this problem difficult: stochastic actions and latent states. Stochastic 
actions, when applied in the same state will not always result int the same outcome. This type of uncertainty 
can arise from many sources; the outcome of chaotic actions are impossible to predict with certainty, 
think of throwing a die or flipping a coin; In outdoor robotics the terrain might lead to slippage, causing 
the robot to skid or underwater currents might drastically offset the position of an UAV; In articulated 
robots the friction between joints can accumulate to a large error in the end-effector position (especially true 
for cable driven robots). 
The second source of uncertainty is when the underlying state is partially known, in the sense that we do not 
have all the necessary information to reliably determine the state beyond reasonable doubt. In robotics this 
uncertainty can arise from inadequate or noisy sensors. If the environmental conditions in which the robot 
is located is humid, misty or dark. It can make it difficult for the robot to ascertain its position and 
to plan how to achieve a given objective.

The uncertainty of the state and actions have to be quantified. The predominant approach 
is to  represent them by probabilities. For instance the application of a forward action (for a wheeled robot) 
will result in a new position further ahead and a position to the right (due to slippage) with some probability.
An observation through the robots sensors will result in probability distribution over the robots probable location.
Given this quantification of action and observation uncertainty in terms of a probability distribution over the state, 
the agent must now take actions towards accomplishing its goal. To take a decision the agent must assign a utility 
to the outcome of his actions. The utility is to indicate a preference over the outcomes and when combined with 
probabilities leads to decision theory. 

\subsection{Decision theory}

The central question of decision theory is; \textit{how do we take decisions when faced with uncertain outcomes ?} To answer
such a question we need to ground the attributes which are involved when we take a decision, namely our \textbf{beliefs} and 
\textbf{desires}. Beliefs reflect a degree of knowledge we have about the world in which the degree is ascertained by 
the amount of evidence we have in support of our beliefs. Epistemology studies in great detail the relationship between 
truth, beliefs and knowledge. We will not go into a philosophical discussion of their interplay, but make use of the following; 
if we have sufficient evidence in support of our beliefs and they represent the truth then we consider them to 
be a \textbf{rational belief}. As for desires they are linked to our disposition to take action to achieve them; for 
example if I want to switch of my alarm clock I have to look for it in the last area I believed it to be. 
These two attributes, beliefs and desires, are used to frame a decision problem. Early work in decision theory assumed 
that the problem was well grounded and focused on finding what are the \textbf{rational choices} to take given our beliefs 
to achieve our desires.

Early interest in such questions were typically centred around economics such as deciding what should be an appropriate 
investment or wager for a particular gamble. It was noted that the expected monitory outcome of a gamble as a mean of basing a 
decision, would often lead to a course of action which contradicts common sense; a famous example is the St. Petersburg paradox.
In this paradox a bookmaker proposes you the following gamble. An initial pot starts with a content of 2\pounds, the bookmaker proceeds 
to flip a fair coin until the first appearance of a tails which ends the game. Until the occurrence of the first tails 
the money in the pot doubles after every toss. Once the game ends you leave with the content of the pot. As an avid gambler 
and expected value maximiser how much would you be willing to pay to enter this gamble ? A value maximiser would computed 
the expected monetary outcome. The amount of money increases by $2^{n}\pounds$, where $n$ is the number of non-final tosses and 
and the probability of reaching $n$ is $1/2^{n}$. In this case the expected monitory outcome is an infinite number,

\begin{equation*}
\displaystyle \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{p(n)}\{\pounds\} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} 2 \pounds}_{\textrm{first toss}} + \frac{1}{4} 4 \pounds + \dots = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} 
\frac{2^{n}}{2^{n}}\pounds = \infty \pounds 
\end{equation*}

So your expected gain or return for paying to enter such game is an infinite amount of money, so in principal if you were
seeking to maximise your expected return value you would be willing to pay an amount close to infinity. This does not 
seem a good decision rule; no person in the world would be willing to pay more than $1\pounds$ to enter such game.

Nicola Bernoulli proposed a solution to the problem (later published by his brother Daniel  (\cite{Bernoulli1954})) by introducing the notion 
of a \textbf{utility function}, and he claimed that people should base their decision on the expected utility instead 
of solely the monetary outcomes of a gamble.

\begin{quote}
  \onehalfspacing% <--- Local line spacing
  ``...the value of an item must not be based on its price, but rather on the utility it yields."\par\raggedleft--- \textup{Daniel Bernoulli}
\end{quote}

The introduction of a utility function takes into account that the net worth of a person will influence their decision since 
different people (in terms of their monetary worth) will weigh the gain differently. The utility function introduced by Bernoulli 
was the logarithm of the monetary outcome $x \in X$ weighted by their probability $p(x)$ which results in an expected utility, 

\begin{equation*}\label{eq:exp_utility}
  U(X) = \displaystyle \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{p(x=X)} \{ u(x) \} = \sum_{x\in X} p(x) \underbrace{\log(x)}_{u(x)}
\end{equation*}

Different utility functions characterise different levels of risk. When the it is concave as it for Bernoulli's utility function
the person will be \textbf{risk-averse}, when linear \textbf{risk-neural} and convex \textbf{risk-seeking}. 
This was the first introduction of a utility function.

It is later in 1944 that von Neumann and Morgenstern (\cite{VonNeumann1944}) axiomised Bernoulli's utility function 
and proved that if a decision maker has a preference over a set of lotteries\footnote{the term lottery refers 
to a probability distribution in the original text.} which satisfy four axioms
(completeness, transitivity, continuity, independence) then there exists a utility function who's expectation 
preserves this preference. An agent whose decisions can be shown to maximise the vNM expected utility are said 
to be \textbf{rational} and otherwise \textbf{irrational}.  This is the theoretical basis of most economic theory,
it is a \textbf{normative} model of how people should behave given uncertainty. It is also the basis of most 
if not all decision making, cogitative architectures and control policies in AI and robotics 
(to the best of the authors knowledge).

An aspect to keep in mind regarding the vNM model is that it is normative; it states what should be a rational decision 
or behaviour. As a result it is not always consistent with human behaviour. There is great debate regarding 
the predictions made by vNM models with respect to ours. There have been many studies both demonstrating divergence 
between the models predictions and our observed behaviour but also supporting evidence that it does reflect 
the output of our decision making process. Reasons for divergence have been attributed to the way we 
weigh probabilities and how the decision problem is framed. But probably the most important aspect is that 
in most decisions we are faced with the quantification and rationality of our beliefs might not be adequate
and limitations of our working memory will come into play in the final decision.

Nevertheless vNM agents are predominantly used in AI and robotics as a means of implementing 
a decision making process or a control policy. In psychology and cogitative science vNM agents
are a used for comparing human behaviour against an optimal strategy (by optimal we mean it is rational in 
the vNM sense).

\section{Sequential decision process}

When referring outright to Decision theory with no extensions, we usually are talking about a one shot
non temporal decision. However many interesting decision problems are sequential by nature.
In such a situation we must consider the effect our current decisions will have on our later future decisions. Expected utility 
theory (part of decision theory) is extendable to a temporal decision problem. The traditional way of 
representing a temporal decision problem is by an \textbf{influence diagram} or a \textbf{Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN)}. 
In an influence diagram and a DBNs random variables are represented by nodes, the utility by diamonds and the arrows represent 
relations. From the graphical representation it is easy to write down the joint distribution over the random variables and 
conditional independence and dependence relations can be read. Influence diagrams are used to model a finite temporal decision 
process (also called finite-horizon) whilst DBNs are for infinite continuously recurring sequential decisions 
which is tailored to model infinite-horizon stationary decision process. By stationarity we imply that the 
decisions are independent of time.

\subsection{Solving a sequential decision process}

Lets consider a decision problem of length $T$ in a world which has $N$ states. 
Given an utility function we first want to find the initial action, $a_0$ which will
be optimal. This means that the action maximises the expected utility 
given all resulting future states and actions. 
%,a_{1:T},x_{1:T}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:utility_one}
	a^*_0 = \argmax_{a_0}  \overbrace{\displaystyle \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{p(x_{0:T},a_{0:T-1})} \{ u(x_{0:T}) \}}^{U(a_0,x_0=x^{[i]})} \\
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:utility_one}, is the maximisation of the expected utility at time step $0$ given that we are 
starting in state $i$ and that every following action is optimal (also maximise the expected 
utility). The utility and associated probability of this utility are given by Equation  \ref{eq:utility_one_var}
\begin{align}\label{eq:utility_one_var}
  u(x_{0:T}) 	     &= r(x_0) + \gamma r(x_1) + \gamma^2 r(x_2) + \cdots + \gamma^{T} r(x_T)\\
  p(x_{0:T},a_{0:T-1}) &= p(x_0) \prod_{t=0}^{T-1} p(x_{t+1}|x_t,a_t)
\end{align}

To find the first optimal action we have to consider the expected utility for all $N$ states and take the action which has the highest value,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:max_util}
  U(a_0,x_0 = x^{[i]}) =  \cdots \max_{a_{T-2}} \sum\limits_{x_{T-1}} \max_{a_{T-1}} \ \sum\limits_{x_T} p(x_{0:T},a_{0:T-1})  u(x_{0:T})
\end{equation}

Solving the above directly in its current form would have an exponential time complexity, $\BigO(N^T)$. By making use of the first order 
markov assumption and that current rewards do not dependent future rewards, the sums in Equation \label{eq:max_util} can be re-arranged.

% Solving the above is known as the most probable explentation. 

\begin{align}
 &U(a_0,x_0=x^{[i]}) =\cdots \max_{a_{T-2}} \sum\limits_{x_{T-1}}  \nonumber\\
 &p(x_{0:T-1},a_{0:T-2})  \left( u(x_{0:T-2}) +  + \max_{a_{T-1}} \gamma^{T} \sum\limits_{x_{T}} p(x_{T}|x_{T-1},a_{T-1}) r(x_{T}) \right)
\end{align}






% applying the method on a finite-horizon Markov Decision processes is equivalent to Value Iteration where the argmax in each iteration is solved be means of an inference query.
%The first change is to the 
%utility function itself. 

%To be consistent with the literature regarding sequential decision processes, namely 
%work in operational research, AI, optimal control theory and 

%There are two main forms 
%of representing such as decision problem:  in, markov decision processes, partially observable

A POMDP is a popular approach for formulating a decision making process under both motion and measurement uncertainty;
In Figure \ref{fig:pomdp_tik} we describe all of the components necessary for a POMDP.

Since the states are not observable, the agent cannot choose its actions based on the state. The explicit 
representation of the past events is typically memory expensive. Instead it is possible to summarize all relevant 
information from previous actions and observations in a probability distribution over the state space, known as the
belief state. 

Because the state space is partially observable the expected reward has to be computed for each possible history of states, actions and observations.
All approaches in the literature instead encapsulate all these possible histories into a belief state $b_t(x_t)$ which is a 
probability distribution (referred to in the POMDP literature as an information state, \textit{I}-state) over the state space $x_t$ and use this 
new state description to cast the POMDP into a \textit{belief}-MDP (states are probability distributions, beliefs). 

The new description of the problem is now in terms of belief space $<\mathcal{B},U,\tau,R,\gamma>$ where $\mathcal{B}$ is the set of 
all possible beliefs and 
The reward becomes a function of the belief $R(b_t,u_t)$ which is the expected value of the original reward 
function $\mathbb{E}_{x_t \sim b_t}[R(x_t,u_t)]$, The goal is to find an optimal action for each belief such that 
the policy $\pi(b_t,u_t)$ maximises the expected reward, Equation \ref{eq:optimal_value_f}.

\begin{align}\label{eq:optimal_value_f}
% V^{\pi^*}(b_{t-1}) &= \mathbb{E}\left[\sum\limits_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^{t} R(x_t,u_t) \bigg| \pi,b_{t-1}\right]\\
 V^{\pi^*}(b_{t-1}) &= \max_{u_{t-1}} \bigg[ R(b_{t-1},u_{t-1}) + \gamma \cdot \mathbb{E}_{y_t}\left[ V^{\pi}(b_t)  \right] \bigg]
\end{align}

From considering the decision belief tree of the POMDP, Figure \ref{fig:pomdp_bel_tree}, we can appreciate the complexity of the problem
of finding an optimal policy. Given a discrete set of actions and observations to update the belief $b_1$ we have to consider a time 
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(|U||Y|^T)$ where $T$ is the depth of the tree (the planning horizon). Given that we have a finite set of 
belief the complexity solving the POMDP is $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{B}||U||Y|^T)$.

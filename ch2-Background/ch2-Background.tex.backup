\chapter{Background}

% Introduce what is planning under uncertainty
Planning and reasoning under uncertainty is central to robotic and artificial intelligence research and has 
been an active area of research for decades. Acting under uncertainty is an umbrella term which touches a
wide spectrum of fields: \textit{economics}, \textit{psychology}, \textit{cognitive science}, \textit{neuroscience},
\textit{robotics} and \textit{artificial intelligence}. The work in this thesis relies on results  and assumptions 
made in cognitive and neuroscience with respect to our beliefs and how we act given them. We complement 
these results by introducing them in a new light to the field of robotics and demonstrate how the human reasoning and belief system 
can be used in situations where the state space is partially observable. The second main theme our work builds on is 
state space estimation. The third component acting given uncertainty in robotics. We make use of results from all 
three fields.


% What did we start off with and where are we now. What are the current achievements or reasonin under uncertainty and 
% what are still the open problem.

% It is a very broad area of research since we borrow elements from the human belief system and theory of mind. 
% 
%	1) Acting under uncertainty is not an easy problem. 
%
%	
%
%
%	--- We are all about how to reason and act given uncertainty. 
%	Decision theory and operational research (historical context)
%	Bayesian Theory of Mind (Cognitive side of things). We are risk averse etc..

Hi Guillaume,

This is a good first draft. I have minor remark. Please, work some on the coherence of the introduction to the contributions. 
It is crucial to give a global picture. A schematic would help. Miao had made a nice one to give an overview of the different parts of his work. 
It can be a good example to follow.

Best,
Aude

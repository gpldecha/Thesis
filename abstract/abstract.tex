hitting motions, and bipedal locomotion have been encoded through either symbolic, statistical or dynamical system representations. 
In contrast there has been less focus on transferring higher cognitive behaviour, such as problem solving skills and search strategies,
from humans to robots.

Our aim is to model how humans reason with respect to their beliefs and the role uncertainty plays during spatial navigation search tasks. 
We consider for instance tasks such as localising  an object in a room or connection a plug to a power socket in the dark, 
or any such situation with total suppression of visual information, and transfer this reasoning mechanisms to a robot apprentice. 
There are many robotic application domains in which uncertainty resulting from a lack of visual perception is common, such as in underwater 
maintenance, planetary exploration and occluded manipulation tasks. Learning human search models and transferring them to robots is useful
in such domains and learning a search strategy from scratch would prove intractable.

The aim of this thesis is to model human search strategies in spatial navigation tasks in which a high amount of uncertainty is present.
%The aim of this thesis is to model how humans reason with respect to their beliefs and the role uncertainty plays during spatial navigation search tasks.

%We chose to focus on proprioceptive and haptic feedback, since it is vital in motor control 
%coordination. As humans we can do nearly just as much without vision than with it (with some readjustment).

A difficulty in learning human reasoning mechanisms in the search scenarios we consider, is that the humans'  
sensations (haptic and tactile) and beliefs are unobservable and they vary within and across subjects. 
We infer the human's sensations from either the relationship between the kinematic body of the human and the known geometric description of 
the environment or a tool equipped with a sensor (force-torque sensor). The sensations are transformed 
to a binary feature vector which encodes whether contacts have been made with the environment's features such as surfaces, edges and corners. 

We model the human's beliefs by a probability density function which we update through recursive Bayesian 
state space estimation using motion estimates, acquired through a tracking system (the human subjects wore markers), 
and the sensation estimates were obtained as described above. We make the assumption that the probability 
density function, representing the human's belief, is updated by a Bayesian recursion and that this process is similar to the way in 
which humans integrate information.

To model the reasoning processes of human subjects performing the search tasks we learn a generative joint distribution over beliefs
and actions (end-effector velocities) which were recorded during the executions of the task. 
The high dimensionality of the belief and its varying complexity  during the searches required that we compress the 
belief to its most likely state and entropy. 

We evaluate this methodology of learning search strategies in a task consisting of finding an object on a table. 
We demonstrate that multiple search strategies are encoded in the joint belief-action distribution and 
we compare this approach with greedy myopic and coastal navigation search algorithms. The results show that the human learned 
search model is the fastest of all methods.

We consider in a second setting a task in which human subjects have to demonstrate how 
to search for and connect a plug to a power socket to a robot apprentice deprived of visual information. 
We take the same approach but incorporate the learning of the policy into a reinforcement learning framework 
and demonstrate that by defining a simple cost function the quality of the final learned policy can be significantly
improved without the need of performing exploratory rollouts which are costly and typically necessary in RL.

Both search tasks above can be considered as active localisation in the sense that uncertainty originates from the position of 
the human or robot in the world. We now consider search setting in which both the position of the robot and and aspects of environment 
are uncertain. Given the unstructured nature of the belief a histogram parametrisation of the joint distribution over the robot 
and the environment is necessary. However, naively doing so becomes quickly intractable as the computational cost is exponential in 
terms of the parametrisation. We demonstrate that by only parametrising
the marginals and by memorising the parameters of the measurement likelihood functions we can recover the exact 
same solution as the naive parametrisations at a cost which is linear in space and time complexity as oppose to exponential.

Both the above search tasks can be considered as active localisation in the sense there is uncertainty only in the position of 
the human or robot in the world. We finally consider a search setting in which both the position of the robot and aspects of the environment 
are uncertain. Given the unstructured nature of the belief, a histogram parametrisation of the joint distribution over the robot's position 
and environmental features is necessary. However, this method quickly becomes infeasible as the computational cost is exponential in 
terms of the parametrisation. We demonstrate that by parametrising only the marginals and by memorising the parameters of the measurement likelihood functions 
we can obtain the exact same solution at a cost which is linear as opposed to exponential in space and time complexity.

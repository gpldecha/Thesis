	arbitrary gestures. We aim at extracting a representation that encapsulates
	only the key aspects of the gesture and discards the variability
	intrinsic to each person's motion. We compare a decomposition into
	principal components (PCA) and independent components (ICA) as a
	first step of preprocessing in order to decorrelate and denoise the
	data, as well as to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to make
	this one tractable. In a second stage of processing, we explore the
	use of a probabilistic encoding through continuous Hidden Markov
	Models (HMMs), as a way to encapsulate the sequential nature and
	intrinsic variability of the motions in stochastic finite state automata.
	Finally, the method is validated in a humanoid robot to reproduce
	a variety of gestures performed by a human demonstrator.},

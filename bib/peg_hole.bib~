abstract ={
               This article will show conclusively that "kinematic instability" is not inherent to the hybrid position/force control scheme of robot manipulators but is a result of an incomplete and inap propriate formulation. The inverse of the manipulator Jacobian matrix is identified as causing the kinematic instability of the hybrid position/force control scheme. Linear algebra is used to explain clearly the implications of mapping between vec tor spaces and to reveal why the inverse of the manipulator Jacobian matrix should not be used in hybrid position/force control. A generalized architecture for hybrid position/force control is presented that can influence both joint positions and torques. This generalized formulation also includes the control of redundant manipulators. Some sufficient conditions for kine matic stability are proposed to determine when a system may become unstable without requiring a complete system analysis. A stable hybrid position/force control scheme is given and is demonstrated using an example that was previously shown to be unstable.

@article{EBurdet1999,
abstract = {This paper explores a stepwise learning approach based on a system's decomposition into functional subsystems. Two case studies are examined: a visually guided robot that learns to track a maneuvering object, and a robot that learns to use the information from a force sensor in order to put a peg into a hole. These two applications show the features and advantages of the proposed approach: i) the subsystems naturally arise as functional components of the hardware and software; ii) these subsystems are building blocks of the robot behavior and can be combined in several ways for performing various tasks; iii) this decomposition makes it easier to check the performances and detect the cause of a malfunction; iv) only those subsystems for which a satisfactory solution is not available need to be learned; v) the strategy proposed for coordinating the optimization of all subsystems ensures an improvement at the task-level; vi) the overall system's behavior is significantly improved by the stepwise learning approach.},

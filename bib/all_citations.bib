	arbitrary gestures. We aim at extracting a representation that encapsulates
	only the key aspects of the gesture and discards the variability
	intrinsic to each person's motion. We compare a decomposition into
	principal components (PCA) and independent components (ICA) as a
	first step of preprocessing in order to decorrelate and denoise the
	data, as well as to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to make
	this one tractable. In a second stage of processing, we explore the
	use of a probabilistic encoding through continuous Hidden Markov
	Models (HMMs), as a way to encapsulate the sequential nature and
	intrinsic variability of the motions in stochastic finite state automata.
	Finally, the method is validated in a humanoid robot to reproduce
	a variety of gestures performed by a human demonstrator.},

abstract ={Proposed in the 18th century by Cramer and Bernoulli and formally axiomatized in the 20th century by von Neumann and Morgenstern and others, the expected utility model has long been the dominant framework for the analysis of decision-making under risk. A growing body of experimental evidence, however, indicates that individuals systematically violate the key behavioral assumption of this model, the so-called independence axiom. This has led to the development and analysis of nonexpected utility models of decision-making. Although recent work in this area has shown that the analytical results of expected utility theory are more robust than previously supposed, other important issues remain unresolved.},

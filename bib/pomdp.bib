% Belief space compression

@article{belief_compression_2005,
    abstract = {{Human beings take for granted their ability to move around and interact with each other in a wide range of environments.  These same environments are tremendous sources of uncertainty for mobile robots. Not only does navigation introduce positional  uncertainty, but systems that try to interact with human beings are faced with the tremendously noisy and ambiguous  behaviours that humans exhibit. More recent planners have been developed that to handle the non-deterministic and unexpected  outcomes of actions. For example, a number of probabilistic planners model the real world as a Markov process.  However, most such planners assume that the true state of the world can always be determined accurately, an assumption that  is . In an world without enough structure, tracking the current position of a robot is hard; the sensors cannot reliably track the  environment as the robot moves.  The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) constitutes a particular planning methodology th...}},

@article{bs_compression_2010,
    abstract = {{Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is a commonly adopted mathematical framework for solving planning problems in stochastic environments. However, computing the optimal policy of POMDP for large-scale problems is known to be intractable, where the high dimensionality of the underlying belief space is one of the major causes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates two different approaches for reducing the dimensionality of the belief space: 1) belief compression and 2) value-directed compression. In particular, a novel orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization is derived for the belief compression, which is then integrated in a value-directed framework for computing the policy. In addition, with the conjecture that a properly partitioned belief space can have its per-cluster intrinsic dimension further reduced, we propose to apply a  k -means-like clustering technique to partition the belief space to form a set of sub-POMDPs before applying the dimension reduction techniques to each of them. We have evaluated the proposed belief compression and clustering approaches based on a set of benchmark problems and demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing the cost for computing policies, with the quality of the policies being retained.}},

abstract ={Proposed in the 18th century by Cramer and Bernoulli and formally axiomatized in the 20th century by von Neumann and Morgenstern and others, the expected utility model has long been the dominant framework for the analysis of decision-making under risk. A growing body of experimental evidence, however, indicates that individuals systematically violate the key behavioral assumption of this model, the so-called independence axiom. This has led to the development and analysis of nonexpected utility models of decision-making. Although recent work in this area has shown that the analytical results of expected utility theory are more robust than previously supposed, other important issues remain unresolved.},

@article{DRQ_AAAI_2015,
	author = {Matthew Hausknecht and Peter Stone},
	title = {Deep Recurrent Q-Learning for Partially Observable MDPs},
	conference = {AAAI Fall Symposium Series},
	year = {2015},
	keywords = {Deep Reinforcement Learning; LSTM; Deep Networks; Reinforcement Learning; Atari; Deep Q-Learning},
	abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning has yielded proficient controllers for complex tasks. However, these controllers have limited memory and rely on being able to perceive the complete game screen at each decision point. To address these shortcomings, this article investigates the effects of adding recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing the first post-convolutional fully-connected layer with a recurrent LSTM. The resulting Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN), although capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN's performance on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial observations and evaluated with incrementally more complete observations, DRQN's performance scales as a function of observability. Conversely, when trained with full observations and evaluated with partial observations, DRQN's performance degrades less than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's input layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learning to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of observations changes.},
